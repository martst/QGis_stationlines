   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Station Lines
============================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

.. index:: Concepts

Concepts
===========
The plugin creates station lines with some parameters

.. index:: stations_choices
Stations choices
==================

Stations can be at vertices and/or at equally spaced distance.

If both are checked, stations are ordered along the path of the polyline.


.. index:: distance
Distance
------------

Input :

:Field: Field with a numerical value (Int or Float)
:Value: A fixed numercial value

.. index:: side
Side
======

Side is:

* Left: station lines are on left side
.. image:: _images/side_left.png
    :scale: 50
* Right: station lines are on right side
.. image:: _images/side_right.png
    :scale: 50
* Both: station lines are on left and right side

Input:

:Field: String value with:

* 0 = Right
* 1 = Left
* 2 = Both
* Right (and all variants: RIGHT, RigHt, ...)
* Left (and all variants: LEFT, LEfT, ...)
* Both (and all variants: BOTH, BotH, ...)

:Value: A fixed string value

.. index:: length
Length
==========

A negative value provide the opposite side. For example, Right side with a negative value is like Left side with a positive value.

Input:

:Field: Field with a numerical value (Int or Float)
:Value: A fixed numercial value


.. index:: angle
Angle
=======
Angles are in degree and are normalized.

Examples by side (Red line is a polyline):

Right
-------

Left

    :scale: 20
Both
-----
.. image:: _images/both_0-180.png
    :scale: 20
.. image:: _images/both_180-360.png
    :scale: 20


Input:

:Field: Field with a numerical value (Int or Float. Can be negative)
:Value: A fixed numercial value between 0 and 360


.. index:: output
Output
========

Station lines are created on a single layer with these attributes:

* FID: ID of the original linestring
* SL_ID: ID of the station lines. Each SL have a unique ID
* SL_SEGMENT: ID of the segment of the linestring
* SL_ANGLE: Angle of the SL
* SL_LENGTH: Length of the SL
* SL_ORIENT: Orientation/Side of the SL
